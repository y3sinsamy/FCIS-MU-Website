# Zaker Website

<b>Zaker</b> is an open-source website whose purpose is to help students study by collecting lectures and explanations and organizing them into one place that the student can access to find everything he is looking for.

The platform aims to create a suitable environment that allows the student to delve deeper into his studying by isolating him from all other distractions, such as social media sites and others, while providing a graphical interface that encourages the student to study at the same time.

I hope that this project will help students, especially my colleagues at the Faculty of Computers and Information, Mansoura University, to study better than before and that this will help them advance in their academic lives in some way.
